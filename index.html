                <a href="img/01.jpg"><img src="img/01.jpg" alt="Hay Bales"></a>
                <span>I love hay bales. Took this snap on a drive through the countryside past some straw fields.</span>
                <a href="img/02.jpg"><img src="img/02.jpg" alt="Lake"></a>
                <span>The lake was so calm today. We had a great view of the snow on the mountains from here.</span>
                <a href="img/03.jpg"><img src="img/03.jpg" alt="Canyon"></a>
                <span>I hiked to the top of the mountain and got this picture of the canyon and trees below.</span>
                <a href="img/04.jpg"><img src="img/04.jpg" alt="Iceberg"></a>
                <span>It was amazing to see an iceberg up close, it was so cold but didnâ€™t snow today.</span>
                <a href="img/05.jpg"><img src="img/05.jpg" alt="Desert"></a>
                <span>The red cliffs were beautiful. It was really hot in the desert but we did a lot of walking through the canyons.</span>
                <a href="img/06.jpg"><img src="img/06.jpg" alt="Fall"></a>
                <span>Fall is coming, I love when the leaves on the trees start to change color.</span>
                <a href="img/07.jpg"><img src="img/07.jpg" alt="Plantation"></a>
                <span>I drove past this plantation yesterday, everything is so green!</span>
                <a href="img/08.jpg"><img src="img/08.jpg" alt="Dunes"></a>
                <span>My summer vacation to the Oregon Coast. I love the sandy dunes!</span>
                <a href="img/09.jpg"><img src="img/09.jpg" alt="Countryside Lane"></a>
                <span>We enjoyed a quiet stroll down this countryside lane. </span>
                <a href="img/10.jpg"><img src="img/10.jpg" alt="Sunset"></a>
                <span>Sunset at the coast! The sky turned a lovely shade of orange.</span>
                <a href="img/11.jpg"><img src="img/11.jpg" alt="Cave"></a>
                <span>I did a tour of a cave today and the view of the landscape below was breathtaking.</span>
                <a href="img/12.jpg"><img src="img/12.jpg" alt="Bluebells"></a>
                <span>I walked through this meadow of bluebells and got a good view of the snow on the mountain before the fog came in </span>
